Audio Modeling using LSTM Neural Network in Python

Due to size limits, please convert the mp3 file to wav (it won't work if not converted).
Epoch : 100 (Approx 120sec/epoch on Win10-12Gb-2.8Ghz) 

Actually working on :
 - Reduce audio file size by converting (bitrate for ex)
 - Choosing the best epoch number
 - Using 100 audio file to develop a new model
 - Working on algo performances and precision
 - Detect silences (not significant/relevant)
 
 Notes : 
 - The model is already saved.
 - Model can be generated by putting False in the LSTM_func arguments.
